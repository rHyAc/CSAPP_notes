The remaining bytes in the register for instructions that generate less than 8 bytes:
	1. instructions that generate 1-or 2-byte quantities leave the remaining bytes unchanged
	2. instructions that generate 4-byte quantities set the upper 4 bytes of the register to zero

AT&T assembly format addressing modes
	Imm(rb, ri, s): Imm + R[rb] + R[ri] * s
		1. s must be 1, 2, 4, or 8
		2. rb and ri must be 64-bit registers
		3. Imm is signed

Instructions
	mov instructions
		cannot have both operands refer to memory locations
	movq 
		only have immediate source operands that can be represented as 32-bit two'scomplement numbers,
		this value is then sign extended to produce the 64-bit value for the destination.
	movabsq 
		can have an arbitrary 64-bit immediate value as its source operand 
		and can only have a register as a destination
	
	cltq(has no operands)
		sign-extend %eax to %rax
		
	movzlq does not exist, because movl have the same effect
	
	pushq S
		R[%rsp] ← R[%rsp] –8
		M[R[%rsp]] ← S
	popq D
		D ← M[R[%rsp]];
		D ← M[R[%rsp]];
		
	leaq S, D
		1. D ← &S
		2. can be used to compactly describe common arithmetic operations
		   e.g.
			@register %rdx contains value x, set register %rax to 5x + 7
			leaq 7(%rdx,%rdx,4), %rax
			
	add, subb, imul(one form), xor, or, and
		1. two operands cannot both be memory locations
		2. when the second operand is a memory location, the processor must read the value from memory,
		   perform the operation, and then write the result back to memory
		   
	shift instructions
		can specify the shift amount  either as an immediate value or with the low m bits 
		in the single-byte register %cl, where 2 ^ m less than the bit length of the value to shift
	
	imulq S(the other form)
		1. R[%rdx]:R[ %rax ] ← S * R[%rax]
		2. signed full multiply
	mulq S
		1. R[%rdx]:R[%rax] ← S * R[%rax]
		2. unsigned full multiply
	cqto
		1. R[%rdx]:R[%rax] ← SignExtend(R[%rax])
		2. convert to oct word, needed before div instructions
	idivq S
		1. R[%rdx] ← R[%rdx]:R[%rax] % S;
		   R[%rax] ← R[%rdx]:R[%rax] / S
		2. signed divide
	divq S
		1. R[%rdx] ← R[%rdx]:R[%rax] % S;
		   R[%rax] ← R[%rdx]:R[%rax] / S
		2. unsigned divide
	—— S can't be Imm

		s1 - s2
	test(s2, s1) instructions
		s1 & s2

		as its destination, setting a single byte to 0 or to 1 depending on some combination of 
		the condition codes

		   or a memory location where the target is stored 
		   
	jp
		1. jump when PF set 1
		2. used to conditionally jump when a floating-point comparison yields an unordered result
		   (when either operand is NaN)
	
	cmov(z, nz, s, ns, g, le...) instructions
		1. transfer the data from the source register or memory location to the destination register,

	vmovaps(aligned packed single)
	vmovapd(aligned packed double)

		   when the dest operand is xmm, the high 128 bits of it are cleared to 0
		2. data need to be 16/32-byte aligned

Condition registers
	CF: carry flag. The most recent operation generated a carry out of the most significant bit. 
	    Used to detect overflow for unsigned operations.
	ZF: zero flag. The most recent operation yielded zero.
	SF: sign flag. The most recent operation yielded a negative value.
	OF: overflow flag. The most recent operation caused a two'scomplement overflow—either negative or positive.
	
	PF: when comparing 2 float point operands, the flag is set when either operand is NaN
	
	1. leaq does not alter any condition codes
	2. for the logical operations, the carry and overflow flags are set to zero
	3. for the shift operations, the carry flag is set to the last bit shifted out, 
	   while the overflow flag is set to zero
	4. the inc and dec instructions set the overflow and zero flags, but they leave the carry flag unchanged
	
	5.  the values of the carry and zero flags in float-point comparison are the same as those for an
	    unsigned comparison, except for unordered case.

Pass arguments
	when passing parameters on the stack, each argument size is rounded up to be multiples of eight bytes

Pointer subtraction
	when two pointers are subtracted, both shall point to elements of the same array object,
	or one past the last element of the array object; the result is the difference of the subscripts of 
	the two array elements. The size of the result is implementation-defined, 
	and its type (a signed integer type) is ptrdiff_t

Floating-Point constants
	unlike integer arithmetic operations, AVX floating-point operations cannot have immediate values as operands. 
	Instead, it must allocate and initialize storage for any constant values.
