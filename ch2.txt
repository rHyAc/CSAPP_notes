Shift operation in C
  1. having bit representation [xw−1,xw−2,…,x0], the shift amount k should be a value between 0 and w – 1
     (when k >= w, the behavior is not guaranteed according to C standards)
  2. The C standards do not precisely define which type of right shift should be used with signed 
     numbers—either arithmetic or logical shifts may be used(arithmetic one is often used). 
     For unsigned data, right shifts must be logical.
