1. the address translation hardware reads the page table each time it converts a virtual address to a physical address. 
   The operating system is responsible for maintaining the contents of the page table and transferring pages 
   back and forth between disk and DRAM (if missing, MMU triggers an exception, which transfers control in the CPU to 
   a page fault exception handler in the operating system kernel)

2. the strategy of waiting until the last moment to swap in a page, when a miss occurs, is known as demand paging 
   that is used in modern systems but not page prefetching
   
3. programs will tend to work on a smaller set of active pages known as the working set or resident set

4. permission bits can be added to each page table entry (PTE)
